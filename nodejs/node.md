## The Node REPL

REPL is an abbreviation for read–eval–print loop. It’s a program that loops, or repeatedly cycles, through three different states: a read state where the program reads input from a user, the eval state where the program evaluates the user’s input, and the print state where the program prints out its evaluation to a console. Then it loops through these states again.

When you install Node, it comes with a built-in JavaScript REPL. You can access the REPL by typing the command node (with nothing after it) into the terminal and hitting enter. A > character will show up in the terminal indicating the REPL is running and prompting your input. The Node REPL will evaluate your input line by line.

By default, you indicate the input is ready for eval when you hit enter. If you’d like to type multiple lines and then have them evaluated at once you can type .editor while in the REPL. Once in “editor” mode, you can type CONTROLD when you’re ready for the input to be evaluated. Each session of the REPL has a single shared memory; you can access any variables or functions you define until you exit the REPL.

A REPL can be extremely useful for performing calculations, learning a language, and developing code. It’s a place where you can explore language features and try things out while receiving immediate feedback. Figuring out how to do this outside of the browser or a website can be really empowering.

The Node environment contains a number of Node-specific global elements in addition to those built into the JavaScript language. Every Node-specific global property sits inside the the Node global object. This object contains a number of useful properties and methods that are available anywhere in the Node environment.

Let’s try out the Node REPL. This will be a good way for you to explore the Node global object!

## Accessing the Process Object

In computer science, a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed. You can open Task Manager if you’re on a Windows machine or Activity Monitor from a Mac to see information about the various processes running on your computer right now. Node has a global process object with useful methods and information about the current process.

The process.env property is an object which stores and controls information about the environment in which the process is currently running. For example, the process.env object contains a PWD property which holds a string with the directory in which the current process is located. It can be useful to have some if/else logic in a program depending on the current environment— a web application in a development phase might perform different tasks than when it’s live to users. We could store this information on the process.env. One convention is to add a property to process.env with the key NODE_ENV and a value of either production or development.

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.log('Testing! Testing! Does everything work?');
}
```

The process.memoryUsage() returns information on the CPU demands of the current process. It returns a property that looks similar to this:

```javascript
{ rss: 26247168,
  heapTotal: 5767168,
  heapUsed: 3573032,
  external: 8772
}
```

Heap can mean different things in different contexts: a heap can refer to a specific data structure, but it can also refer to the a block of computer memory. process.memoryUsage().heapUsed will return a number representing how many bytes of memory the current process is using.

The process.argv property holds an array of command line values provided when the current process was initiated. The first element in the array is the absolute path to Node, which ran the process. The second element in the array is the path to the file that’s running. The following elements will be any command line arguments provided when the process was initiated. Command line arguments are separated from one another with spaces.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Node is often described as having event-driven architecture. Let’s explore what that means.

In traditional imperative programming, we give the computer a series of instructions to execute in a pre-defined order. In contrast, when we write web applications, we often need to write logic to handle situations without knowing exactly when they’ll occur. For example, when programming a website, we might provide functionality for a click event without knowing when a user will trigger it. When Node was created, it applied this same concept of event-driven principles to the back-end environment.

Node provides an EventEmitter class which we can access by requiring in the events core module:

```javascript
// Require in the 'events' core module
let events = require('events');

// Create an instance of the EventEmitter class
let myEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();
```

Each event emitter instance has an .on() method which assigns a listener callback function to a named event. The .on() method takes as its first argument the name of the event as a string and, as its second argument, the listener callback function.

Each event emitter instance also has an .emit() method which announces a named event has occurred. The .emit() method takes as its first argument the name of the event as a string and, as its second argument, the data that should be passed into the listener callback function.

```javascript
let newUserListener = (data) => {
  console.log(`We have a new user: ${data}.`);
};

// Assign the newUserListener function as the listener callback for 'new user' events
myEmitter.on('new user', newUserListener);

// Emit a 'new user' event
myEmitter.emit('new user', 'Lily Pad'); //newUserListener will be invoked with 'Lily Pad'
```
