## Flow of HTML

A browser will render the elements of an HTML document that has no CSS from left to right, top to bottom, in the same order as they exist in the document. This is called the flow of elements in HTML.

In addition to the properties that it provides to style HTML elements, CSS includes properties that change how a browser positions elements. These properties specify where an element is located on a page, if the element can share lines with other elements, and other related attributes.

In this lesson, you will learn five properties for adjusting the position of HTML elements in the browser:

- position
- display
- z-index
- float
- clear

Each of these properties will allow us to position and view elements on a web page. They can be used in conjunction with any other styling properties you may know.

## Position

The default position of an element can be changed by setting its position property. The position property can take one of four values:

- static - the default value (it does not need to be specified)
- relative
- absolute
- fixed

### Position: Relative

One way to modify the default position of an element is by setting its position property to relative.

This value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.

```css
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
}
```

Although the code in the example above instructs the browser to expect a relative positioning of the div, it does not specify where the div should be positioned on the page.

```css
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the <div> has been positioned using two of the four offset properties. The valid offset properties are:

- top - moves the element down.
- bottom - moves the element up.
- left - moves the element right.
- right - moves the element left.

### Position: Absolute

When an element‚Äôs position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element.

```css
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

### Position: Absolute

We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed.

```css
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> will remain fixed to its position no matter where the user scrolls on the page,

### Position: Fixed

We can fix an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed.

```css
.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

## Z-index

When boxes on a web page have a combination of different positions, the boxes (and therefore, their content) can overlap with each other, making the content difficult to read or consume.

```css
.box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
}
```

In the example above, the .box-bottom <div> ignores the .box-top <div> and overlaps it as a user scrolls.

The z-index property controls how far ‚Äúback‚Äù or how far ‚Äúforward‚Äù an element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This can be thought of the depth of elements, with deeper elements appearing behind shallower elements.

The z-index property accepts integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct the browser on the order in which elements should be displayed on the web page.

```css
box-top {
  background-color: Aquamarine;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
}

.box-bottom {
  background-color: DeepSkyBlue;
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

In the example above, we set the .box-top position to relative and the z-index to 2. We changed position to relative, because the z-index property does not work on static elements. The z-index of 2 moves the .box-top element forward, because it is greater than the .box-bottom z-index, 1

## Inline Display üßÄ

Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover three values for the display property: `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`.

The default display for some tags, such as <em>, <strong>, and <a>, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. For example, the text of an anchor tag (<a>) will, by default, be displayed on the same line as the surrounding text, and it will only be as wide as necessary to contain its content. inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.

```css
To learn more about <em>inline</em> elements, read <a href="#">MDN documentation</a>.
```

In the example above, the <em> element is inline, because it displays its content on the same line as the content surrounding it, including the anchor tag. This example will display:

To learn more about inline elements, read MDN documentation.

The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.

```css
h1 {
  display: inline;
}
```

## Block Display

Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.

Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements (<h1> through <h6>), <p>, <div> and <footer>. For a complete list of block level elements, visit the MDN documentation.

```css
strong {
  display: block;
}
```

## Inline-Block Display

The third value for the display property is inline-block. Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.

For example, <div>s in the CSS below will be displayed on the same line and with the specified dimensions:

```css
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>I‚Äôm a rectangle!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>So am I!</p>
</div>
<div class="rectangle">
  <p>Me three!</p>
</div>
```

```css
.rectangle {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
}
```

In the example above, there are three rectangular divs that each contain a paragraph of text. The .rectangle <div>s will all appear inline (provided there is enough space from left to right) with a width of 200 pixels and height of 300 pixels, even though the text inside of them may not require 200 pixels by 300 pixels of space.

## Float

So far, you‚Äôve learned how to specify the exact position of an element using offset properties. If you‚Äôre simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the float property.

The float property can be set to one of two values:

- `left` - this value will move, or float, elements as far left as possible.
- `right` - this value will move elements as far right as possible.

## Clear

The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at once. However, when multiple floated elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically, elements can ‚Äúbump‚Äù into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.

The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:

- left ‚Äî the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
- right ‚Äî the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.
- both ‚Äî neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.
- none ‚Äî the element can touch either side.

```css
div {
  width: 200px;
  float: left;
}

div.special {
  clear: left;
}
```

In the example above, all <div>s on the page are floated to the left side. The element with class special did not move all the way to the left because a taller <div> blocked its positioning. By setting its clear property to left, the special <div> will be moved all the way to the left side of the page.
